## Getting Started

If you want to make your own adjustments, you can also clone this repository and sideload the extension, adhering to the installation guidelines below.
Either way, make sure that the following prerequisites are met before you perform the installation.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the Developer Mode for Chrome extensions activated:
1. navigate to ```chrome://extensions/```
2. toggle the _Developer Mode_ switch

As a further requirement, Developer Tools experiments must be enabled and custom UI themes allowed:
1. navigate to ```chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments```
2. enable the _Developer Tools experiments_ flag
3. in the settings panel of your Developer Tools, toggle the _Allow custom UI themes_ experiment

### Installing

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jaysuz/material-dev-tools.git
```

In the ```chrome://extensions/``` window, use the _Load unpacked_ button to load this extension from the location where
you cloned the repository.

To test the new theme, make sure the extension is activated and open the Chrome devtools on a page of your choosing. As
this theme is meant as a replacement for the dark theme, you first need to switch to the native dark theme of the 
devtools to see any effect.
